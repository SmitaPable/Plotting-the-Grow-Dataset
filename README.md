# Plotting-the-Grow-Dataset
In this python script we have utilized pandas, matplotlib libraries to plot GROW sensor locations from the "Growlocations.csv" dataset on a UK map ("map7.png"). The process involves filtering the dataset to remove invalid coordinates and focus on specific latitude and longitude ranges (i.e.The bounding box for the map is as follows: Longitude Min -10.592, Longitude Max 1.6848, Latitude Min 50.681, Latitude Max 57.985). The script then displays the original and filtered dataframes, opens the UK map image, and creates scatter plots showcasing the sensor locations. The resulting visualizations include a simple scatter plot, a scatter plot overlaid on the UK map, and a detailed map with labeled axes and equal aspect ratio. The script aims to provide a clear representation of GROW sensor locations within specified geographical bounds.
